# CMS Machine Learning Hands-on Advanced Tutorial Session (HATS)

## Introduction

This is a set of tutorials for the CMS Machine Learning Hands-on Advanced Tutorial Session (HATS). They are intended to show you how to build machine learning models in python (Keras/TensorFlow) and use them in your ROOT-based analyses. We will build event-level classifiers for differentiating gluon fusion and VBF Higgs to 4 muon events and jet-level classifiers for differentiating boosted W boson jets from QCD jets.

# Main notebooks in this tutorial

 0. `0-setup-libraries.ipynb`
 1. `1-datasets.ipynb`
 2. `2-plotting.ipynb`
 3. `3-dense.ipynb`
 4. `4-preprocessing.ipynb`
 5. `5-conv2d.ipynb`

## Setup

To download the tutorials, type

```
git clone https://github.com/FNALLPC/machine-learning-hats
```

and hit shift-enter in your notebook. After a few seconds, you should see output like this:

```
Cloning into 'machine-learning-hats'...
remote: Counting objects: 9, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (7/7), done.
remote: Total 9 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (9/9), done.
```

and in your directory tab, there's a new directory called `machine-learning-hats`. All of the tutorials and exercises are in there.
